# 📰 Fake News Detection using Machine Learning

This project is aimed at detecting fake news using machine learning and natural language processing techniques. It classifies news headlines or articles as either **Fake** or **Real**.

## 📌 Features

- Preprocessing of raw news text (tokenization, stopwords removal, etc.)
- Feature extraction using TF-IDF vectorization
- Model training using Logistic Regression
- Simple manual testing function for user input
- Evaluation metrics for model performance

## 🚀 Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK)

## 🔍 Dataset

We use a publicly available dataset of labeled news articles which includes both fake and real news.

## 🛠 How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/fake-news-detection.git
   cd fake-news-detection
